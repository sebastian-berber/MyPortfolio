## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Write an SQL query to create a new dataframe about baseball players who attended BYU-Idaho. The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary, and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Order the table by salary (highest to lowest) and print out the table in your report.__

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

q = '''
    SELECT p.playerID
    ,      cp.schoolID
    ,      salary
    ,      s.yearID
    ,      s.teamID
    FROM people p
    LEFT JOIN collegeplaying cp
      ON cp.playerID = p.playerID
    INNER JOIN schools sc
      ON sc.schoolID = cp.schoolID
    LEFT JOIN salaries s
      ON p.playerID = s.playerID
    WHERE cp.schoolID = 'idbyuid'
    ORDER BY salary DESC

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__This three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)__

_a. Write an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report._

```{python}
#| label: Q2a
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

q = '''
    SELECT playerID
    ,      yearID
    ,      ((1.0 * H) / AB) AS 'Batting_Average'
    FROM batting
    WHERE AB >= 1
    ORDER BY Batting_Average DESC, playerid
    LIMIT 5
'''

results2 = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)

results2
```


_b. Use the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results._

```{python}
#| label: Q2b
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

q = '''
    SELECT playerID
    ,      yearID
    ,      ((1.0 * H) / AB) AS 'Batting_Average'
    FROM batting
    WHERE AB >= 10
    ORDER BY Batting_Average DESC, playerid
    LIMIT 5
'''

results3 = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)

results3

```

_c. Now calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results._

```{python}
#| label: Q2c
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

q = '''
    SELECT playerID
    ,      SUM(H) AS 'Total_Hits'
    ,      SUM(AB) AS 'Total_At_Bats'
    ,      ((SUM(H) * 1.0) / SUM(AB)) AS 'Batting_Average'
    FROM batting
    WHERE AB >= 100
    GROUP BY playerID
    LIMIT 5
'''

results3 = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)

results3


```


## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Pick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Write an SQL query to get the data you need, then make a graph using Plotly Express to visualize the comparison. What do you learn?__


```{python}
#| label: Q3
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

q = '''
    SELECT name
    ,      SUM(W) AS 'Wins'
    ,      SUM(G) AS 'Total Games'
    ,      (SUM(W) / (SUM(G) * 1.0)) AS "Win_Rate"
    FROM teams
    WHERE name IN ('New York Giants', 'Boston Red Sox')
    GROUP BY name

'''
results4 = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)

results4
```
